**Webscraping IMDb wesbite and developing dataset for visualizations:**


I will start my first data science blog post by admitting that I was extremely anxious and scared coming into this project. I did not know what to expect and assumed the worst coming into it. I was nervous beyond belief, but that all changed once I started working on it. I had a flawed misconception, believing I had to have memorized everything I was going over in my data science curriculum on Flatiron School. I'm glad to say that is not the case, and in fact, the data science community is very helpful and motivating. Stackoverflow, and Github became my best friends during the process. It was encouraging to see that there were many people that didn't know what I didn't know either, but collectively we could all achieve the end goal together. 

I started off the project very rusty, taking a long time to research certain things, but once I got into the groove of things it became a lot easier. I noticed that everyday it was a process of getting my brain and mental state ready for the work ahead. I never knew I'd love data science as much as I do. I enjoy the data wrangling, data cleaning, rendering of visualizations and everything in-between. Although, it can be a little frustating at first, it feels so good when you upload the finished product and have something to show for in your academic portfolio. 
    
I started my project by first scraping the page of 250 movies, and retreiving all the relevant information I needed to build my dataset. Then I went ahead and cleaned the dataset by dropping all nan values and erroneous data points. I made sure the formatting of the dataset and the datatypes were ready for exploration before starting my visualizations. I hope you take the time to look over my first attempt at a complete data science project and don't hesitate to let me know what you think and/or any recommendations you may have to help me improve. I will include the link to my Github module 1 project below.
