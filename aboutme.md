My name is Christian Lopez. I grew up in San Jose, California, but now residing in Las Vegas, NV. Currently an online student at the University of California - San Diego. I'm majoring in cognitive neuroscience with a minor in psychology and attending the Flatiron School online data science bootcamp at the time of this posting. 

- I am the proud father to a beautiful little frenchie-boston mix 
- I love to be around my family and friends
- I enjoy playing soccer and anything involving sports/outdoor activities 
- I love to learn ... learn ... and learn 
- I relish in the idea of picking at my brain with new ideas and concepts

And that was a little background about me. Anything else you'd want to know?
